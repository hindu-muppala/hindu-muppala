Hi, I’m a Software Engineer who believes curiosity opens new ways to solve problems.

My interests in Blockchain, AI, Cybersecurity.

I enjoy building clean, user-friendly applications and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects. I love exploring how systems work under the hood and finding smarter, more efficient solutions.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript | React.js | Docker | Git | GitHub | JQuery | AWS | Spacy | Bash Scriptimg | Linux | SQLite | MongoDB 

Outside of coding, you’ll find me jogging — it helps me reset, think clearly, and come back stronger to solve the next challenge.
